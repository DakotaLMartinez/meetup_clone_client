# Meetup Clone Client

To get started with this repository, you can run:

```bash
npm install
```

Followed by

```bash
npm start
```

The dev server is set up to run on port 4000 and will proxy fetch requests to `http://localhost:3000`. If you'd like to code along with what I'm doing in part 1 of the lecture, feel free to clone down this repository so you can test out the functionality in the browser.
